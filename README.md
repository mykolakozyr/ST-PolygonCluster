# ST-PolygonCluster
This library provides tools for clustering polygon geometries based on spatial and temporal proximity. Unlike traditional clustering libraries that focus on point geometries, this library is designed to handle polygons, identifying neighbors through overlapping geometries or within a specified radius.
